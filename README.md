gulp-raml
=========
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JohanObrink/gulp-raml.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JohanObrink/gulp-raml)

A gulp plugin for parsing raml using [RAML Parser](https://github.com/raml-org/raml-js-parser)

*If you think you recognize the structure of the files, tests, code and README, it is because I used [gulp-jshint](https://github.com/spenceralger/gulp-jshint) as a template. All credit for this plug-in goes to [Spencer](https://github.com/spenceralger).*

##Install

    npm install gulp-raml

##Usage

```javascript
var raml = require('gulp-raml');
var gulp = require('gulp');

gulp.task('raml', function() {
  gulp.src('./raml/*.raml')
    .pipe(raml())
    .pipe(raml.reporter('default'));
});
```

##Results
Adds the following properties to the file object

```javascript
file.raml.success = true; // or false
file.raml.message = {}; // RAML Parser error
file.raml.data = {}; // Parsed RAML object
```

##Reporters

###Default
Will console.log pretty, pretty errors

###Fail
Do you want the task to fail when a RAML Parse error happens? gulp-raml includes a simple utility for this.

This example will log the errors using the default reporter, then fail if RAML Parse was not a success.

```javascript
stuff
  .pipe(raml())
  .pipe(raml.reporter('default'))
  .pipe(raml.reporter('fail'))
```
